# Java RPG game


## Project Description
It is a  RPG game, where Pikachu is trying to escape from Ash and win his freedom. 
Other similar types of games include Pokemon and Zelda. Like in these games, pikachu can move around the map to collect items to help him, and has to fight enemies on the way, before finally fighting the final boss. The game is smaller and shorter than these games, but it has multiple maps and types of enemies to fight. The graphics will also have to be simpler than a full game such as Pokemon or Zelda.

## How to start text-version:
    
    1. Download the files in https://github.com/myosubug/java-rpg-game/

    2. Unzip the file and locate the folder you unzipped in your command terminal.

    3. Locate your position into "text-version" folder in your command terminal.

    4. Use command "javac TextApp.java" to compile.

    5. Use command "java TextApp" to run the game.

## How to start GUI-version:
    
    1. Download the files in https://github.com/myosubug/java-rpg-game/

    2. Unzip the file and locate the folder you unzipped in your command terminal.

    3. Locate your position into "GUI-version" folder in your command terminal.

## How to run unit test:

    In "GUI-version" folder, there is a folder named "testFile"

    The folder contains 3 files:
    - GUIAppTest.java
    - hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
    - junit-4.12.jar


    * GUIAppTest.java contains unit tests and its descriptions about what parts of application are being tested.


    To begin the unit tests for this application, copy all of the 3 files and paste it into "GUI-version" folder (One upper level from "testFile" folder). Then,

    1) Locate your position into "GUI-version" folder in your terminal.

    2) Copy and paste this command into your terminal and hit enter to compile.

        javac -cp .:junit-4.12.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar *.java

    3) Copy and paste this command into your terminal and hit enter to run tests.

        java -cp .:junit-4.12.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore GUIAppTest
